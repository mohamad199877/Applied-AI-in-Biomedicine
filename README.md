# Heart Beat Classifier

## Introduction
Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal classification is a crucial task in biomedical engineering, particularly for diagnosing and monitoring heart conditions. This project aims to develop a beat classifier for PPG signals to classify each beat into:
- **Normal (N)**
- **Supraventricular (S)**
- **Ventricular (V)**

Accurate classification of these beats is vital for detecting arrhythmias and other cardiac anomalies, which can significantly impact patient outcomes.

## Objective
In this assignment, we:
- Use a dataset comprising PPG signals from 105 patients with varying sampling frequencies.
- Preprocess these signals.
- Train a classifier.
- Evaluate its performance in distinguishing between different types of heartbeats.

## Methodology
The primary goals include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the PPG signals for analysis.
2. **Classifier Training**: Implement and train a model to classify the heartbeats.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the classifier.

## Report Structure
- **Materials and Methods**: Detailed explanation of the dataset, preprocessing techniques, and model architecture.
- **Results**: Presentation of the outcomes from our experiments.
- **Discussion**: Analysis and interpretation of the results.
- **Conclusion**: Summary of our findings and suggestions for future research directions.
