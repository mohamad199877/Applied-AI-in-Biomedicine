**Introduction**
Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal classification is a
crucial task in biomedical engineering, particularly for
diagnosing and monitoring heart conditions. This project
aims to develop a beat classifier for PPG signals to classify
each beat into Normal (N), Supraventricular (S), and
Ventricular (V). Accurate classification of these beats is
vital for detecting arrhythmias and other cardiac anomalies,
which can significantly impact patient outcomes.
In this assignment, we use a dataset comprising PPG
signals from 105 patients with varying sampling
frequencies. The primary goal is to preprocess these
signals, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance in
distinguishing between the different types of heartbeats.
The subsequent sections of this report will detail the
materials and methods used, including data preprocessing
techniques, model architecture, and training procedures.
We will then present the results obtained from our
experiments, followed by a discussion on the implications
of these findings. Finally, we will conclude with a
summary of our work and suggestions for future research
directions.
